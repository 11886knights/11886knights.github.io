# Welcome

We are Catholic men building a bridge back to faith mainly from Holy Name of Jesus parish in Kingston Mills and Holy Family Chapel at CFB Kingston.

There is much work to be done in this world. Good work. Necessary work. And that’s what the knights do every day.

Assisting the sick and disabled. Protecting those who can’t protect themselves. Whether they are next door of halfway around the world. This is the journey we are on. Our path.

We do it to be better husbands, fathers, sons, neighbours, and Catholics. We invest our time into our values:

- Charity
- Unity
- Fraternity
- Patriotism

We come from many places, backgrounds and stages in our lives. A fraternity of men striving to better themselves and our world.

It’s one thing to say who you are. It’s another to live it. Put your values into action. That’s what we do at the Knights of Columbus. That's who we are.
