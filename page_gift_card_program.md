**Supporting our Parish, our Community and other charitable activities**

Its simple, buy a gift card and use as cash for those every day things: gas, groceries, clothing, dining, coffee, and more. You'll be spending the same money you would spend anyways while supporting a great cause. Between 2010-2019, profits from selling Gift cards provided $9K to Holy Name of Jesus, $10.6K for Knights of Columbus (K of C) charities and events, and $2.8K for Holy Family Chapel = Total $22.4K. What a difference!
