All the good works we do are informed by our four core principles:

**Charity** - There is no better way to experience love and compassion than by helping those in need, a call we answer every day.

**Unity** – Together – we can accomplish far more than any of us could individually. You can count on the support and encouragement of your brother Knights as you work to make life better in your parish and community.

 **Fraternity** – We watch out for and take care of one another.

**Patriotism** – We are proud of our devotion to God and country, and believe in standing up for both.
