## Family

Whether supporting less fortunate families, leading our families in faith, or just having some family fun, there are several programs available to engage Catholic men and their families. You are welcome to give us a test drive, helping hands always apprecitated.

Ontario K of C established a bursary program to assist Knights and members of their families entering the first year of a post-secondary education.  Successful applicants are eligible a $1,000.00 Bursary. Applicants can be:
