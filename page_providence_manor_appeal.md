The Knights of Columbus Diocesan Association has begun its appeal in favour of the new Providence Manor.

The operating license on the current facility expires in 2025. The upgrades and standards expected to renew the licenses require so much effort that a new facility is the logical choice.  The Sisters of Providence have donated land on their Heathfield property next to the Motherhouse. (Princess St Kingston)
 
The greater community must raise about $12 to 15 Million in order to leverage the relevant provincial and federal government funds to complete the build.  Providence Care which manages Providence Manor is coordinating its fundraising effort through University Hospitals Kingston Foundation (UHKF).
The funds must be promised in time for the commitments to be considered in the building design and build, and of course the residence must be moved in to the new facility before the license on the current residence expires.  So there is little time to waste.
 
Councils are about to begin elections and set budgets for the new fraternal year.   Our role is to assist in the education and awareness of each council and assembly in order that they can individually set their path for a formal commitment by December 2017 outlining their pledge over the next five years.   A Knight within the Diocese has pledged to match all amounts up to a total of $100,000.00 so every dollar that K of C can influence will be important in leveraging these additional sums.
 
Those donations can be direct from the council but also can be donations from individuals who would receive their own charitable donation receipt but would also be  credited to your council's total. This recognizes the full impact that the Knights can make within their community and also assists in leveraging the matching funds.
 
The Knights Providence Manor Appeal committee will guide you through the process to commit your support and making the donations through UHKF count towards your council recognition, K of C recognition and leveraging the matching funds.
 
A committe member will visit any council/assembly to assist, train and support  a local member who is eagerly interested in the Providence Manor Campaign. 
 
Please contact us to open the discussion on how we can support you in making a worthy commitment of fundraising support over the next five years.
