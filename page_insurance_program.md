During our founding in 1882,Venerable Father Michael J. McGivney and his fellow Knights “passed the hat” to benefit widows and orphans.  From that humble start, the Order has grown to include top-rated life insurance, long-term care insurance and retirement products.  Not a pleasant topic until you need it but don't have it.
